Holiday Card README
===================
This is the repository for a Holiday Card Generator by Antoinette Janus. This Holiday Card Generator was built with Meteor, React, AWS S3 (for file management), Flow Router (for routing), jQuery, as well as some other packages. 

How to Use (The How)
--------------------

Behind the Project (The What)
-----------------------------
This project is a rebuild plus expansion of my original CodePen, my [Holiday Card Generator](http://codepen.io/acjdesigns/EPypzr). I chose a prebuilt piece that had room for possible expansion beyond the original project so that I could focus on learning in terms of React, versus learning, building, and designing. 

A Further Breakdown (The Why)
-----------------------------
*  Meteor
*  MongoDB
*  React
*  Flow Router vs. Iron Router
*  File Storage

Updates
=======
Below are planned updates. I've broken down the updates into two groups: to get done and want to get done. The "Planned Updates" will get done first and the "Longer Term Updates" will get done afterwards.

Planned Updates:
----------------
*  Private card options
*  Write up instructions and post to GitHub
*  Code in instructions
*  Social Media share icons on the "Share" modal when finished creating an e-Card
*  More Background Images

Longer Term Updates:
--------------------
*  E-mail e-card from the "Share" modal
*  Custom Background Images through file upload
*  Giphy API search support
